    "Problem statementFor this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon ofyour choosing.  You may pick any phenomenon you wish – you might pick one that isof interest to you in your personal or professional life.  Then, rather than collect datarelated to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python.We suggest you use thenumpy.randompackage for this purpose.Specifically, in this project you should:•Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you couldcollect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.•Investigate  the  types  of  variables  involved,  their  likely  distributions,  and  theirrelationships with each other.•Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.•Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – thedata set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.Note that this project is about simulation – you must synthesise a data set.  Somestudents may already have some real-world data sets in their own files.  It is okay tobase your synthesised data set on these should you wish (please reference it if you do),but the main task in this project is to create a synthesised data set.  The next sectiongives an example project idea."
